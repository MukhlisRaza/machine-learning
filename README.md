# machine learning
Machine learning is getting computers to program themselves.Any information or data sent to a computer is considered input. Data produced by a computer is considered output. In the machine learning community, input data is referred to as the *feature set* and output data is referred to as the *target*. The feature set is also referred to as the *feature space*. Sample data is typically referred to as *training data*. Once the algorithm is trained with sample data, it can make predictions on new data. New data is typically referred to
as *test data*. Machine learning is divided into two main areas: **supervised and unsupervised learning**.

### What is Dummy Variables and One Hot Encoding
To use categorical variables in a machine learning model, you first need to represent them in a quantitative way. The two most common approaches are to one-hot encode the variables using or to use dummy variables.
